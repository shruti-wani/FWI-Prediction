Milestone 2 – Ridge Regression Model


Overview
This milestone builds a Ridge Regression model to predict FWI (Fire Weather Index) using the cleaned dataset from Milestone 1.

Key Steps:
Loaded clean_data.csv
Removed non-feature columns: day, month, year, Classes, Region
Selected top correlated features with FWI
Split data into train/test sets
Applied StandardScaler
Trained Ridge models across multiple alpha values
Evaluated: MSE, RMSE, MAE, R²
Selected the best model (lowest test MSE)

Outputs :
scaler.pkl — fitted StandardScaler
ridge.pkl — best Ridge model
ridge_alpha_metrics.csv — metrics for all alphas

Plots:
RMSE vs Alpha
MSE vs Alpha
MAE vs Alpha
Actual vs Predicted

Conclusion:
Ridge Regression was tuned across many alpha values, and the best-performing model was saved along with evaluation plots and metrics.
